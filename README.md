# Introduction to A/B Testing
28-29 September 2023

## Overview

A/B testing is a powerful tool for product development and decision making. It is used to compare two versions of a product or service to determine which one performs better. In this workshop, we will learn how to use A/B testing to make data-driven decisions. We will start with a refresher on data analysis and statistics, and then dive into Bayesian statistics and A/B testing. We will learn how to implement A/B testing in Python using PyMC, and discuss various factors that can impact the test result. By the end of the workshop, you will be able to use A/B testing to make data-driven decisions in your projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of Bayesian A/B testing
- Be able to implement Bayesian A/B testing in Python to solve real-world problems
- Be able to analyse the imact of sample size and prior beliefs on the results of A/B testing
- Be able to communicate and explain results to non-technical audience


## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python
- Basic knowledge of statistics
